# Flashcard-Generator

This node application allows the user to create either basic or cloze flashcards through user input. A Basic card has a front and back while a cloze card has a phrase with the answer omitted. The data will then be stored on a seperate file.

THe user will also be able to use these cards as well. The application will pose the card as a quetion and compares user input to the answer and tells the user if they are correct.
